# tm-roller
A specific dice roller to generate a number and quality for TYPE-MOON style magic circuits. Best used for Character Creation for RP scenarios.

# Why?
I recently got into Tsukihime and Fate. The pseudo-metaphysics is a bit fascinating. As such, I wanted to adopt the way magic is handled in the Nasuverse for many of my own magical characters. However, I didn't want to pull out a high number and rank each time. To best emulate the process, as the number and quality is determined at birth and usually set in stone, I whipped out my Dart skills and threw this together. 

# There's two branches..
Yes. The original version of the program seemed too overpowered. After looking into the Regression to the Age of the Gods, I figured the original program would best serve that angle. The 'main branch' serves as a reflection of the Parameters rules.
