# tm-roller
A specific dice roller to generate a number and quality for TYPE-MOON style magic circuits. Best used for Character Creation for RP scenarios.

# Why?
I recently got into Tsukihime and Fate. The pseudo-metaphysics, while a load of bunk, is a bit fascinating. As such, I wanted to adopt the way magic is handled in the Nasuverse for many of my own magical characters. However, I didn't want to pull out a high number and rank each time. To best emulate the process, as the number and quality is determined at birth and usually set in stone, I whipped out my Dart skills and threw this together. 

# There's two branches...
Yes. The original version of this program (Release 1.0.1 and this branch) seemed way too overpowered. As such, I took the original progression rules and made that the base for the main branch. This branch will still exist for more miraculous spellcasters.
